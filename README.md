# Play Pacman via the Webcam: How to better teach a ML model to read directions

This example shows you how to predict direction from an image in webcam using transfer
learning.

In this example, we'll use a pretrained [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mobilenet) model and train another model
using an internal mobilenet activation to predict 4 different classes from the
webcam defined by the user.
